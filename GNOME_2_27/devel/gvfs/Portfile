description     The Gnome Virtual File System.

long_description \
    gvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem designed \
    to work with the i/o abstractions of gio (a new \
    library available with glib). It installs several \
    modules that are automatically used by applications \
    using the APIs of libgio. The gvfs model differs \
    from e.g. gnome-vfs in that filesystems must be \
    mounted before they are used. There is a central \
    daemon (gvfsd) that handles coordinting mounts, and \
    then each mount is (typically) in its own daemon \
    process (although mounts can share daemon process). \
    gvfs comes with a set of backends, including trash \
    support, sftp, smb, http, dav and others. There is \
    a set of command line programs starting with gvfs- \
    that lets you run commands (like cat, ls, stat, etc) \
    on files in the gvfs.
